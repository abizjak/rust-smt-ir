## rust-smt-ir

This project provides an intermediate representation (IR) in Rust for
[SMT-LIB](https://smt-lib.org/about.shtml) queries along with
tools for performing computations over queries and transforming
queries in various ways.

N.B.: we have recently split this repository so only the IR and transformer 
code is in this repo. Example code has been moved to the 
[rust-smt-ir-examples](https://github.com/awslabs/rust-smt-ir-examples)
repository.
