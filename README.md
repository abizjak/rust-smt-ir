## rust-smt-ir

This project provides an intermediate representation (IR) in Rust for
[SMT-LIB](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/about.shtml) queries along with
tools for performing computations over queries and transforming
queries in various ways.  N.B.: we have recently split this 
repository so only the IR and transformer code is in this repo and 
the example code has been moved to the rust-smt-ir-examples repository.
